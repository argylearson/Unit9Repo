	Your code goes in this class.
	You need to fill out the NurtureTrees method so that for each tree passed in as a parameter,
	it calls the GrowSeeds() and GrowLeaves() method for each tree.
	For example, trees was a list of three trees, you'd need to call GrowSeeds() and GrowLeaves() for the first
	element, then for the second element, and then for the third element of the list.
	
	The issue is that the trees have different types. You'll need to find a way to resolve that. GrowSeeds() and
	GrowLeaves() are not methods for the Object class, so how do you get around that?
	
	For the first part of this project, please refrain from searching for solutions online.
